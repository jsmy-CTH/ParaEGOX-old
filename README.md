# ParaEGOX

ParaEGOX is a distributed Agent OS for robotics and embodied agents, currently being rebuilt from the ground up.

ParaEGOX is based on [PhanthyMotus](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus). The original baseline remains available on the `archive/phanthymotus-baseline` branch, with its license attribution preserved.

## Runnable DeveloperLocal slice

The `paraegox` binary composes the real Authority, DeploymentController, Runtime, Runtime-managed
Zenoh Fabric, ModelService, AgentService, a separate NodeDaemon reference child, owner-private Agent
and Inspection IPC, and an internal Python Textual child. Runtime starts Fabric, then Model, then
Agent, and exposes a conversation capability only after the exact signed PXMT ActiveReady receipt is
durably committed.

There is one public conversation command:

```text
paraegox chat --config <absolute-paraegox.toml>
```

Provider, model, state root, and Fabric listener are selected by the strict versioned TOML config,
not by provider-specific subcommands or override flags. Secret values never belong in config or
argv; config contains only an exact SecretRef. The chat configuration has one credential-free example at
[`configs/paraegox.example.toml`](configs/paraegox.example.toml). It currently selects DeepSeek as a
replaceable validation backend, not as a CLI mode or default model.

The Textual child is installed from this repository's Python project. In a development checkout,
prepare and activate the locked environment before starting `paraegox`; the Rust parent deliberately
has no alternate frontend or transport fallback if the internal `paraegox-console` executable is
absent:

```zsh
uv sync --locked
source .venv/bin/activate
command -v paraegox-console
```

`paraegox-console` is internal packaging, not a second public conversation command. On macOS, keep
the example's state root under canonical `/private/tmp` because `/tmp` is a symlink rejected by the
path policy. The macOS CI artifact contains a SHA-256-checked `tar.gz`; verify its adjacent
`.sha256` file before extraction. The extracted relocatable directory contains `paraegox`, its
executable `paraegox-console` sibling, and vendored packages under `python/`; keep them together and
provide Python 3.11 or newer as `python3` on `PATH`. To exercise the configured DeepSeek path,
supply the referenced Secret through the process environment and pass an absolute config path:

```zsh
read -s 'DEEPSEEK_API_KEY?DeepSeek API key: '; echo
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
CONFIG_PATH="$(pwd)/configs/paraegox.example.toml"
PARAEGOX_BIN=/absolute/path/to/native/paraegox
test -x "$PARAEGOX_BIN"
"$PARAEGOX_BIN" chat --config "$CONFIG_PATH"
unset DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

Build the native binary on the designated server or GitHub CI and download the complete bundle to
the Mac. Do not run Cargo on the Mac for this workflow.

Historical Ubuntu validation of r22 source snapshot `ff2d8109` passed workspace formatting, locked
metadata, and locked all-targets check. It also passed all 39 Inspection tests, all 89
DeveloperLocal tests under a non-root identity, and all 364 Deployment tests under a non-root
identity. That r22 workspace Clippy run exposed approximately 30 historical structural lints rather
than passing. Their corrections are present in later source snapshots, but the r29 macOS artifact
workflow did not run workspace Clippy and is not presented as a fresh Clippy pass.

Native Intel macOS r29 commit `944ce332` run `31238285076` passed the locked Textual tests and full
governance checker, built and verified the public native CLI, staged the relocatable bundle, and ran
the real PTY path through typed Inspection markers, Runtime readiness, Textual-to-Runtime Echo,
priority Ctrl-C, terminal restoration, and joined parent shutdown. It also verified the bundle
checksums, executable modes, archive, and artifact upload. A credentialed external DeepSeek smoke is
still pending, so the configured DeepSeek path must not yet be described as externally validated or
production ready. For an offline substrate check, use the same config schema with
`model.provider = "deterministic-echo-v1"` and omit model/SecretRef; `echo: <message>` proves only the
DeveloperLocal owner chain. The earlier standalone Rust reference frontend has now been removed;
the internal Textual child is the only current presentation path and there is no alternate public
`paraegox chat` entry.

The current A2 slice is non-streaming, permits one Model call in flight, and sends only the current
turn's prompt; conversation-history recall, Memory, Tools, planning, and multi-agent orchestration
remain later Agent Core work. The parent supplies the internal Textual child only owner-private
bootstrap-file paths: one for Agent conversation and, when available, one for read-only local
Inspection. The Python `AgentConversationClient` consumes only the Runtime Agent path and never opens
raw Zenoh or sees provider/model credentials. A separate strict typed client validates the owner-private
PXIB v2 bootstrap and performs exactly one no-retry PXIQ Latest exchange before the Textual App starts;
it strictly correlates the PXIP response and decodes the complete PXIS v2 snapshot. Any bootstrap,
transport, correlation, or snapshot failure prevents the UI from starting. A successful read is shown
as three read-only startup-status lines; there is no watch, retry, cache, background refresh, action,
continuous monitoring, Ops, or federated view. The parent removes both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` from the child environment, and argv carries no raw identity, Node management
capability, Zenoh route, capability token, or Secret. This typed boundary is not a revived all-in-one
ConsoleBridge.

The Node contract, Unix same-tenure durable NodeDaemon state, and read-only management protocol are
now consumed by `paraegox-local`, rather than existing only as a standalone mechanism. The launcher
creates or securely reopens the exact local Node tenure, commits an initial feature-only status,
starts a real separate reference child, and accepts its bounded PXNQ/PXNS Latest response only after
the local management channel, target, tenure, and status fences authenticate. That initial
single-target NodeStatus deliberately contains zero Runtime observations. It therefore does **not**
prove Runtime discovery, continuous observation or reconciliation, a production Zenoh carrier,
registration acquisition, multi-host operation, or distributed readiness. Normal exit joins the
Textual child and Agent IPC boundary first, then Runtime-managed Agent→Model→Fabric shutdown, the
NodeDaemon, and finally Authority.

## Runnable Node host substrate: schemas v1, v2, and v3

The separate public command below always starts one split-trust Runtime and one NodeDaemon child.
Its strict config schema selects the host profile; there is no second G2 command:

```text
paraegox node --config <absolute-node.toml>
```

With `schema_version = 1`, the command retains the validated G1 path: it binds the restricted mTLS
Runtime-apply listener on its fixed legacy generic-rejection behavior, publishes a feature-only Node
status with zero RuntimeHost observations, and verifies the child through one authenticated typed
Latest exchange.

With `schema_version = 2`, the same command additively starts the G2 **host-side** path. The Runtime
listener accepts the bounded Controller-signed PXCC control carrier and returns Runtime-signed PXDR
Describe facts; while LegacyReady it also carries the frozen PXQR query and accepts the authenticated
PXFB one-way cutover. A separate Node listener authenticates the Controller before dispatching
Describe, Latest, Watch, observation-challenge, or Runtime-observation publication through the
existing sole-owner NodeDaemon store and observation capability. Runtime readiness facts are
cross-checked before the observation bridge is created. Schema v2 therefore provides the real
Ubuntu-side listeners, durable owners, and bridge needed by a later external Controller; it does not
embed that Controller in the node process.

With `schema_version = 3`, the Node retains the complete schema-v2 control path and additionally
requires `[managed_agent_bootstrap]` with the exact compiled-in
`provider = "deterministic-echo-v1"` profile. That provider selection, its derived provider ref, and
the Node config digest are committed into the public-safe Runtime-attested PXEA v2 successor at
`<node-state-root>/node/enrollment-v2.pxea`. Desired Fabric/Agent service identities, listen endpoint,
and limits remain Deployment-owned and are not valid Node fields.

All three schemas print `paraegox: node ready` only after their configured local owners and listeners
have started. The marker does not prove that a Controller connected, PXFB cutover completed, a Runtime
observation was published, or a desired Agent stack was applied. None of the schemas starts Authority,
DeploymentController, managed Fabric, Model, Agent, Inspection, Textual, or the chat chain. The
separate public Controller command described below now exists, but there is still no end-to-end
two-host process proof, remote Agent conversation path, remote TUI, or partition/reconnect policy.
The later single-Ubuntu-host smoke exercises the semantic Controller sequence, but does not widen
the meaning of this Node-local marker.

For the T1 profile, start from
[`configs/paraegox-node.agent-bootstrap.example.toml`](configs/paraegox-node.agent-bootstrap.example.toml).
The predecessor schema-v2 example remains at
[`configs/paraegox-node.example.toml`](configs/paraegox-node.example.toml). Copy the selected file to an
absolute regular-file path, replace both documentation-only `192.0.2.10` listener addresses with
IPv4 addresses actually assigned to the host, and update `state_root` plus all six credential paths
together. Before launch, the same non-root account must create the canonical state root and its exact
`credentials` child at mode `0700`. Provision distinct PEM CA/certificate/key files for the Runtime
and Node listeners in that one directory; both certificate SANs must contain their configured IP,
both keys must be mode `0600`, and CA/certificate files must not be group- or other-writable. The
agent-bootstrap example selects schema v3, while the predecessor example selects schema v2. To
retain G1, set `schema_version = 1`, remove both the complete
`[node_control]` and `[managed_agent_bootstrap]` tables, and provision only the three
Runtime-listener files. To retain schema v2, omit only `[managed_agent_bootstrap]`. Both examples
contain only non-secret reference values and public verification keys; replace those pins only from the owning
Controller/Authority enrollment workflow, never with private seeds. Full credential preparation and
launch commands are in the local `docs/runbooks/developer-local.md` runbook.

Ubuntu r33 commit `7618f6a51c5eb5731874d2cdf3231603e3a824f7` passed workspace formatting,
locked metadata, workspace all-target checking, and workspace all-target Clippy with warnings denied.
The complete `paraegox-local` unit binary passed 98/98 tests as a non-root user; nine focused Local
filters and three focused non-root Runtime split-trust/provisioning filters also passed. A real
non-root process smoke reached the readiness marker with exactly one child, one non-loopback TLS
listener and the two expected private Unix sockets. SIGTERM and SIGINT each exited zero, restart
preserved byte-identical PXNI/PXNB hashes, forced child death made the parent fail closed with
`PXLC-NODE-CHILD`, and root launch failed before state with `PXLC-EXECUTION-IDENTITY`. These facts
prove the G1 host-local substrate and cleanup/restart boundary only.

The host-side G2 validation ref is r51 `b1d1206d2187b85d335ae352c226274d8e9d5827`. Ubuntu passed workspace
format checking, the focused public-help test 1/1, the complete governance checker, workspace
all-target checking, workspace all-target Clippy with warnings denied, and the complete non-root
`paraegox-local` suite 111/111. All workspace all-target test executables also compiled and linked
successfully under `--no-run`. Workspace doc tests passed, including two Fabric, one Kernel, and one
runtime-contracts compile-fail doctest; other crates had no doctests. `--no-run` is not a claim that
the complete workspace test suite executed.

Separately, after the PXQR authentication nonce was bound to the exact Node observation challenge,
the corresponding Deployment source/binary lineage passed the complete non-root Deployment suite
374/374. No later change through r51 modified Deployment source, but the handoff did not preserve the
exact immutable ref of that 374/374 invocation. It is therefore lineage evidence, not a claim that
r51 itself reran the Deployment suite.

The real non-root r48 schema-v2 process smoke reached Ready with exactly one hidden Node child, two
non-loopback TLS listeners (`172.17.0.2:28448` and `:28449`), and the expected Runtime, management,
and observation Unix sockets. A provisioned Controller client certificate completed a TLS handshake
with each listener; both rejected a client without a certificate. SIGTERM exited zero and cleaned
up; a same-state restart reached Ready and exited zero with stable PXNI/PXNB/PXND digests. Killing the
Node child made the parent exit one with `PXLC-NODE-CHILD` and removed listeners, PXOB, and processes;
the same state then restarted successfully and SIGINT exited zero. Root launch failed before state
mutation with `PXLC-EXECUTION-IDENTITY`. This proves the r48 host process and mTLS/lifecycle boundary,
not a PXCC/PXNR semantic exchange or cutover. The later public Controller composition does not
retroactively turn this host-only smoke into a two-host control-sequence, remote Agent conversation,
remote TUI, or reconnect result. The older two-target DeveloperLocal fixture remains internal; there
is no public `developer-distributed-fixture-v1` command and no runnable full distributed-system claim
yet.

## Public Developer DeploymentController and T1 Agent bootstrap

The third public command starts one bounded Controller-side owner graph:

```text
paraegox deployment --config <absolute-paraegox-deployment.toml>
```

Its strict TOML schema v1 contains only local filesystem authorities: `state_root`, an exact PXEA
`enrollment_artifact_file` plus its lowercase whole-file `enrollment_artifact_sha256`, separate
Controller and tenure-Authority signing-seed files, the Authority state directory/socket, and
`[runtime_connector]` / `[node_connector]` CA, client-certificate, and client-private-key paths.
Unknown fields and alternate CLI submodes fail closed. Endpoint, route, target, principal, trust,
manifest, and credential-reference semantics are accepted only from the independently pinned PXEA;
they cannot be restated in TOML as a second configuration authority. Additive schema v2 retains
those exact fields and strictly requires `[managed_agent_bootstrap]` with distinct nonzero Fabric
and Agent service IDs, a loopback Fabric listen endpoint, and the fixed
`developer-agent-bootstrap-v1` limits profile. Start T1 from
[`configs/paraegox-deployment.agent-bootstrap.example.toml`](configs/paraegox-deployment.agent-bootstrap.example.toml);
the predecessor schema-v1 example remains at
[`configs/paraegox-deployment.example.toml`](configs/paraegox-deployment.example.toml).

The schema-v2 Node process publishes canonical `<node-state-root>/node/enrollment-v1.pxea`; schema v3
instead publishes `<node-state-root>/node/enrollment-v2.pxea`. Both are published only after the
Runtime and Node bootstraps have been proved. PXEA v2 retains the public-safe Runtime-attested v1
facts and additionally commits the exact provider profile/ref/config digest. It
contains the immutable Runtime manifest and the complete public Runtime/Node transport, identity,
and enrollment pins, but no bearer token, signing seed, private-key bytes, or private-key path. The
Controller side checks an independently transported whole-file SHA-256 before decoding any frame
length, signature, or semantic field, and then cross-checks its separately provisioned Controller
and Authority keys. The artifact signature is continuity evidence, not first-use trust.

`paraegox: deployment ready` has a deliberately narrow meaning. Local can print and flush it only
from the facade's `Ready` outcome, after the remote connector/cutover state is durable, the exact
PXFR managed-serving terminal is durably `ResponseDurable`, and a fresh post-PXFR PXDR Describe has
been verified as `ManagedReady` and durably committed. Delivery uncertainty, a publish state that
needs operator reconciliation, an invalid response, or a ManagedReady Describe without durable PXFR
cannot synthesize readiness; the command joins its owners and exits nonzero with a stable Deployment
error instead. The process performs one bounded non-retrying attempt and is not a continuous
reconciler.

For schema v2, Local prints and flushes exactly
`paraegox: deployment agent bootstrap ready` only after the base managed-ready state and all three
ordered PXAG/PXAH operations are durably terminal: Fabric apply carries the exact PXAR v6 and returns
PXFT ActiveReady; Agent-stack apply carries the exact PXAR v7 and returns PXST ActiveReady; descriptor
Describe returns a PXAH rooted in that exact PXST and current Fabric/Agent generations. The PXFJ v7
journal preserves the exact outer requests and receipts. Same-state Resume revalidates terminal
bytes and reaches the same Ready result without synthesizing a replacement terminal.

Ubuntu validated exact r130 commit `92923eef016e6ce060c32113ad3cf5e59ee8520c` with workspace
format checking, Local all-target checking and warnings-denied Clippy, the complete non-root Local
suite at 138/138 in 49.57 seconds, workspace all-target checking and warnings-denied Clippy, and
compilation/linking of all workspace all-target test executables under `--no-run`. The `--no-run`
result is not a claim that the complete workspace test suite executed. The complete Deployment suite
also passed 393/393 in 172.97 seconds as `nobody`, using a link-count-1 binary, a 16 MiB stack, and one
test thread.

The exact-ref public process smoke passed 1/1 on one Ubuntu host with the same `nobody` UID/GID and
real non-loopback mTLS. It covered schema-v3 Node/PXEA-v2 fresh start, isolated wrong-SHA rejection,
schema-v2 Deployment Fresh Ready and joined SIGTERM, same-state Node and Deployment Resume Ready,
and a Node-unavailable failure with no Ready marker and socket cleanup. The pytest parent used the
default 8192 KiB stack; the harness retained its 16 MiB `RUST_MIN_STACK` fixture setting, and r130
production runs the Deployment root future on its own named bounded 16 MiB executor thread.

The descriptor is bootstrap evidence only. These results do not prove descriptor access or
authorization, an Agent session, Agent data-plane traffic, Echo or conversation, reconnect, a remote
TUI, distributed/two-host execution, provider-mismatch handling, or Authority-owner failure. T2-A
defines the remote-Agent contracts and state graph. T2-B now adds the Fabric transport substrate
described below; Echo, reconnect, and TUI remain later work.

## T2-B asymmetric Fabric transport substrate

Exact ref `0bcc49d03d15cca720021868a08d37912f62128a` adds two role-specific, asymmetric mTLS profiles in
[`paraegox-fabric`](crates/paraegox-fabric/src/service.rs). A single `FabricService` still owns a
single private Zenoh 1.9 `Session`. The Ubuntu-side profile keeps the T1 loopback listener, adds one
non-loopback TLS listener, and has no connectors. The nominal Mac-side profile has one TLS-only
connector and no listeners.

Both profiles use a default-deny policy keyed by the exact peer certificate CN and allow only the
exact remote-Agent submit and control query paths, with the corresponding query, reply, and
queryable directions. The `**` wildcard input is rejected by construction, and the policy has no
put/subscriber allow rule. This is transport configuration, not Runtime activation or authority.

On Ubuntu, the full Fabric suite passed 50/50 tests, with formatting and Clippy clean. The focused
[real-network test](crates/paraegox-fabric/tests/remote_agent_mtls.rs) completed in 7.05 seconds: the
correct CN reached both exact routes; sentinel, parent, and child routes were denied; a same-CA wrong
CN completed TLS/session establishment but was denied by the ACL; the existing same-session local
T1 routes still succeeded; an independent plaintext loopback peer was denied; and shutdown released
both ports. The `**` rejection is constructor/static evidence, not a network case. Likewise, the
absence of put/subscriber allows is statically checked but was not exercised over the network.

The local T1 result relies on the same-session local-face boundary in exactly pinned Zenoh 1.9;
upgrading Zenoh requires rerunning this matrix. A wrong-CN peer can occupy the sole session before
ACL denial, so `max_sessions = 1` remains an availability risk rather than an authentication bypass.
The evidence is a single-Ubuntu-host network test, not proof from a real two-host Mac process.

T2-B does not yet provide a Runtime PXTE9 state owner, real Mac connector composition, an APFS
outbox, a Controller Describe source, a public CLI or marker flow, Echo, reconnect, or TUI.

A Unix-only `paraegox-noded developer-local-reference-v1` process can also reopen one externally
authorized exact tenure and serve its last committed status through a same-user, token-bound local socket.
An additive `developer-local-runtime-observation-v1` mode verifies an existing Runtime-signed PXQR/PXQS
exchange on a separate owner-private local capability socket and atomically publishes the resulting fresh
Node status before acknowledging it. Its short-lived query challenge is bound to the exact Node tenure,
observation endpoint, Runtime authority, apply descriptor, and proposed status sequence. The authenticated
absolute expiry is carried in the status digest and durable state: consumers enforce it in addition to the
relative budget, and after it the management endpoint will not re-serve that observation-backed status. A
multi-Runtime publication uses the earliest retained deadline, so observing one Runtime cannot renew another;
an exact committed request can still recover a lost acknowledgement without renewing freshness. This is a
local authenticated observation adapter, not production Zenoh observation or Runtime apply. Registration
acquisition, continuous reconciliation, two-host proof, federated Inspection/Ops, and the Web Console
remain in progress.
