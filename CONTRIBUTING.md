# Contributing to ParaEGOX

ParaEGOX accepts small, evidence-linked changes that preserve explicit ownership and dependency
boundaries. Architecture documents describe targets; code, tests, and runtime evidence describe
implemented behavior.

## Classify the change

Use the narrowest applicable class. Higher classes include the requirements of lower classes.

| Class | Examples | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | Internal implementation with no public or ownership change | Focused test and lint |
| Public contract | Public Rust/Python API, language-neutral Schema, CLI, configuration field, protocol | Admission record, consumers, compatibility rule, contract test |
| Architecture | New owner, package boundary, dependency direction, persistent format | Accepted or explicitly authorized decision, migration/removal path |
| Runtime/state | Lifecycle, background work, retry, persistence, recovery | Failure, cancellation, restart, and cleanup evidence |
| Safety/security | Authority, physical effect, Secret, sandbox, trust boundary | Independent review and fail-closed evidence |

Do not make every change architectural. A local reversible implementation choice does not need a
new ADR.

## Admit new surfaces

Before adding a top-level package, public contract, service, controller, registry, daemon, public
term, or compatibility layer, record:

- the logical owner and mutation authority;
- existing owners considered and why they are insufficient;
- producer and independent consumer;
- runtime or developer entrypoint;
- first functional or contract test;
- lifecycle and failure boundary;
- compatibility, migration, or removal condition.

Register implementation packages and public APIs in `governance.toml`. A consumer must be an
executable call path, runtime binding, or independently owned/lived integration. The following do
not independently prove consumption:

- a unit test or example;
- documentation, an ADR, a plan, or a future UI;
- a wrapper in the same ownership boundary;
- registration without a runtime call path;
- another abstraction introduced only to consume the first one.

An unconsumed prerequisite may be admitted as `experimental` or `enabler`, but it must remain
internal, identify the bounded batch that will connect it, and include a removal condition. It is
not a completed capability. A strategic CoreService named by an Accepted ADR or authoritative
roadmap may establish its ownership boundary before a real running consumer only when all of the
following are recorded:

- its owner, mutation authority, and explicit non-owner responsibilities;
- a non-placeholder contract and mechanism with focused semantic evidence;
- the exact near-term integration batch or stage that will supply the runtime use path;
- its `experimental`/`enabler` status and the prohibition on presenting it as running capability;
- a batch-end checkpoint that will fold it back, remove it, or merge it if the promised use path
  and evidence do not materialize.

This narrow exception does not apply to ordinary helpers, wrappers, provider adapters, or empty
architecture-shaped packages. Their package separation still requires concrete current evidence.

## Keep ownership smaller than deployment

A logical owner is not automatically a package, class, process, service, store, or manager. Keep
mutation authority explicit, but colocate implementation until isolation, lifecycle, or independent
consumption requires separation. New generic `common`, `shared`, `utils`, `base`, `core`,
`helpers`, `managers`, `registry`, or `framework` boundaries require explicit justification and at
least two independent consumers.

The same rule applies below package level. A new module or source file must own a coherent concern
that materially reduces coupling or protects an admitted boundary. File length, an architecture
diagram, a one-call wrapper, a test-only mirror, or a planned future consumer is not sufficient.
Prefer the smallest complete implementation inside the current owner, and split only when at least
one of these facts is present and recorded in the change evidence:

- a dependency or compile-isolation boundary keeps heavy or provider-specific dependencies out of
  consumers that do not need them;
- a distinct process, restart, deployment, trust, Secret, or failure lifecycle must be isolated;
- a versioned language-neutral contract has an independent producer and consumer;
- two independently owned runtime consumers need the same implementation rather than merely the
  same value shape.

At bounded-batch closeout, remove, merge, or fold back one-use enablers, wrappers, strategic
CoreService foundations, and orphan modules that did not acquire the promised runtime use path and
semantic evidence. Do not preserve fragmentation only because the intermediate files already
exist.

## Keep public surfaces intentional

- New code is internal unless listed in `registry.public_apis`.
- Avoid convenience re-exports from a Rust crate root/prelude or Python package `__init__.py`.
- Do not make deep implementation imports an accidental compatibility promise.
- Public Schema, configuration, CLI, and protocol changes need a version/compatibility rule.
- Cross-process and cross-language contracts must be defined by their Schema, canonical encoding,
  version and compatibility tests, not by Rust memory layout, trait objects, Python objects, or a
  language-specific serializer default.
- Unknown configuration fields fail validation; environment variables must not create a parallel
  configuration authority.

## Control exceptions and legacy

Every suppression, skipped or expected-failure test, CI soft failure, compatibility shim, feature
flag, TODO/FIXME exception, or deprecated surface must have:

- an owner;
- a reason and narrow scope;
- an expiry or removal date;
- a replacement or removal condition.

Waivers live in `registry.waivers`, deprecations in `registry.deprecations`, and feature flags in
`registry.feature_flags` inside `governance.toml`. Reference waivers inline as
`GOV-WAIVER-NNNN`. CI rejects missing, unknown, out-of-scope, unused, or expired waivers.

Compatibility adapters do not own state, form a second runtime entrypoint, silently fall back,
or dual-write. Retry/reconcile likewise has one owner and one budget per operation.

## Work safely with other contributors and agents

- State the intended write set before a multi-file change.
- Only one active change should own a public contract or authority document at a time.
- Re-read changed ADRs, terminology, and package rules before merging.
- Do not overwrite unrelated dirty work or hide it with formatting churn.
- Keep generated artifacts identifiable and reproducible; never edit generated and authoritative
  sources as if both were truth.
- Parallelize disjoint research and implementation, not duplicate builds. One coordinator owns
  Cargo validation for a shared worktree; run the validation ladder serially against the shared
  repository target directory unless a genuinely independent target/toolchain boundary requires
  isolation. Do not launch concurrent workspace checks or per-agent target directories that rebuild
  the same dependency graph.

### Mac source authority and remote Rust validation

For the current ParaEGOX development workflow, the Mac repository is the only writable source of
truth. All source changes, conflict resolution, formatting corrections, and Git history are created
there. A designated Linux build server may consume an exact Git commit/ref or Git patch for Rust
validation, but it is not a development checkout whose source can flow back into the Mac.

- Prefer sending source from Mac to the build server through Git. When Git transport is unavailable,
  an explicit user authorization may permit a one-way fallback consisting only of the required
  uncompressed files or bounded file chunks sent from Mac to a remote temporary path. Verify the
  completed remote file against its Mac SHA-256 digest before atomically replacing the validation
  copy. Tar archives and other compressed source snapshots remain prohibited.
- Never extract, copy, fetch, or merge server-side source into the Mac worktree. Server-generated
  `target` data and Cargo caches remain disposable validation artifacts.
- Run remote formatting in check mode. A failure is fixed in the Mac repository and sent again as a
  new Git object or patch; a remotely formatted file is never imported.
- Record the tested Git object or patch identity so a passing server result is tied to exact Mac
  source. For an explicitly authorized direct-file fallback, also record matching local and remote
  SHA-256 digests for every transferred file. Use locked dependency resolution and do not return a
  server-mutated `Cargo.lock`.
- Any exception to this one-way boundary requires explicit user authorization before the transfer.

## Validate on admitted execution hosts

The repository has a pinned Rust workspace for admitted core slices and Python 3.11/`uv`
governance tooling. The commands below validate those current surfaces; they are not evidence that
a production RuntimeHost exists, and they are not a claim about the eventual ROS2, Jetson,
hardware, or production runtime support matrix. They are the complete repository-wide gates, not a
command list authorizing every host to execute every tool.

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo metadata --format-version 1 --locked
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked

uv sync --locked
uv run --frozen ruff check .
uv run --frozen python scripts/check_governance.py
uv run --frozen pytest
```

### Current Mac source-authority regression

The current Mac source-authority workflow prohibits direct or indirect execution of Cargo, rustc,
rustfmt, or any other Rust build tool. The same rule applies when pytest, a script, task runner,
build helper, or child process would launch the tool. Therefore do not run bare
`uv run --frozen pytest` on this Mac. The complete `scripts/check_governance.py` is prohibited too:
its required workspace check invokes `cargo metadata --locked`, so removing, filtering, mocking, or
bypassing that phase cannot produce valid governance evidence. The permitted non-Rust Mac checks
are:

```bash
uv lock --check
uv run --frozen ruff check .
uv run --frozen pytest tests/agent_worker tests/console tests/contract tests/unit tests/governance/test_s7_pure_compile_boundary.py tests/governance/test_s7_tenure_authority_boundary.py
```

The complete governance checker, its excluded integration test, and all system tests remain
required and run on Ubuntu/CI with the pinned Rust toolchain in this workflow. All Rust commands in
the repository-wide list also remain required on their admitted Ubuntu/CI host. A Mac result may
report the permitted checks that actually ran, but must report the complete governance checker as
not run; it must never claim a governance pass from a Cargo-free subset. This host-specific
orchestration split is not a waiver, a global skip, or a reduction of required validation.

Cargo is the authority for Rust dependencies, builds and tests, while `uv`, Python
`pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` remain
the authority for Python governance tooling, SDKs and workloads. Neither tool may maintain a second
lock or dependency truth for the other ecosystem. `cargo metadata --locked` failure remains a hard
governance failure on the admitted Ubuntu/CI checker host. On the current Mac, report the complete
checker as not run under the host policy rather than skipping its Cargo phase or claiming it passed.

Hardware, external-service, or manually authorized checks remain separate and must not be reported
as passing based on local mocks.
